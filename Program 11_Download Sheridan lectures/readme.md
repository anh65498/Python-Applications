# Download Lana Sheridan Lectures

Sheridan is an amazing Physics teacher at De Anza college that I had the pleasure to study Physics 4C -  fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, waves, light, and optics under. Her lecture slides are amazing so I create an application to let other download her lecture from Physics 4A, 4B, and 4C to save in  local computer (because downloading it manually is boring). User can choose which class to download from and where the folder of downloaded lectures will be
